# Interactive Web Design
Get Baking blog of recipes made using: React.Js, React-Bootstrap and Bootstrap 5
The Recipe blog assignment.
The website link: https://husszaf.github.io/getbaking/

## Design documentation

In the project files there are two folders: design documentation and testing.
Design documentation contains all the logo, low-fidelty, mid-fidelty and sitemap files.
Testing folder contains screenshots of automated testing.

## Website 404 error or blank page
If the website shows the error 404 or it shows a blank empty screen, in the URL search bar type /getbaking at the end of the URL
or retype the website link https://husszaf.github.io/getbaking/. This happens because of the React Router which routes the nav links
as a front end instead of changing it in the URL.
